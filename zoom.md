# Zoom for Moderators

## Pair-Moderating

We will have two hosts on during every timeslot.

* Block 1: Gu & Blanca
* Block 2: Gu & Denise
* Block 3: Denise & Nikki
* Block 4: Denise & Marlena

Pairing means we can split up tasks into broadly two roles:

  1. Emcee

  The Emcee stays in the main room the entire time, introducing speakers,
  making small talk, asking questions triaged from the Q&A. Your focus is on
  the current speaker. The emcee should also keep an eye on the Waiting Room
  when the Stage Manager is away with the next speaker.

  2. Stage Manager

  Keep an eye on the "Waiting Room" and admit people whose names match our
  list as they turn up, so the Emcee can focus on the content.
  The stage manager communicates with the next speaker. When speakers turn up
  ~5 minutes before their talk time, take them into a Breakout Room with just
  yourself, have them practice sharing their screen (important: if they are
  planning to play a video during their talk, they have to know to tick "Share
  Sound From Computer" when they initiate the screenshare). When all is good,
  close down the breakout room and return to the main session with them.

  Shared tasks:

  * Keep an eye out for Code of Conduct violations. Have Discord open in a
    different window if you can, and check in on it every so often. 

  Let's quickly go in turn and have co-hosts figure out which roles they would
  feel more comfortable doing.

## What are we worried about?

1. Zoom-bombing
1. Unwanted participants
1. Unwelcome language in the chat

## What are we doing to prevent/mitigate?

#### Mute by default

All participants will be on mute, and unable to mute themselves. 
Given the number of tickets sold, we are essentially assuming that 
every session will have too large of an audience for two-way communication 
to be manageable, so we are shifting completely to webinar-style delivery.

#### Admit participants one at a time

Using the “waiting room” feature: This is very important. Hosts will have to 
manually admit each person. We will have a master list of all participants 
and the names they used to register, in a searchable Google Sheet. If someone 
requests access and they are NOT in the list, don’t let them in. All ticket 
holders have been told ahead of time to use the same name on Zoom and 
registration. We are the gatekeepers, and we’re the frontline of defense 
for a safe and enjoyable conferencing experience. It’s fine if you see 
“Denise Yu” and “Denise Yu’s iPhone” for example - that usually means that 
someone is having trouble accessing audio from one device, but let us 
know if you see fishy behaviour.

* Exercise: Admitting and removing participants. Request join from my iPad, 
  ask Blanca to deny me
* Exercise: Join again, ask Nikki to admit me. Ask Blanca to remove Denise’s iPad from the meeting

#### Meeting passwords

Password-protecting the Zoom meeting (sometimes people guess the 10-digit 
ID and are able to enter without an invite).

#### Control "write" access

- No participants other than the presenters and hosts may share their screens at any point (?)
- Webinar mode(?) means that participant "chat" is only seen by admins, not
  other participants. It's more of a way of gathering questions for Q&A at the
  end. The hosts will triage and ask the questions on behalf of participants, if
  there is time.
- Know about: the “Lock meeting” feature. We do not anticipate having to use this 
  at all, but know about it as a nuclear option.

## Breakout rooms

Breakout rooms are the only mechanism Zoom provides for smaller group
discussions. However, we will not be using this feature, because it's inflexible
(only the host can move people around) and breakout rooms are impossible to moderate.
We are going to tell all participants to use Discord text chat as the "hallway
track" instead.

- Exercise: Nikki create a breakout room and take Gu into it; Blanca & Marlena; 
  confirm that you can share screen; come back to main

We don’t anticipate using breakout rooms for anything other than sound check for speakers.

## Logistical tips

You can enable "Gallery Mode" while someone is presenting, only if you
fullscreen the app. You don't have to do this if you have one monitor; it's more
important to keep one eye on the Waiting Room and Q&A questions.

If you have a second monitor, it is worth plugging in for this. 
Encourage people to move chat to Discord, for longevity (and, for us - the ability to moderate).
